# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build a comprehensive Neural Steganography Toolkit that consolidates research findings from previous experiments into a production-quality software framework. The toolkit will provide a unified interface for embedding and extracting arbitrary payloads from neural network models, with support for multiple embedding strategies, encryption, evasion techniques, and detection analysis.

The toolkit is designed for security researchers, red teams, and defensive security professionals who need to understand and demonstrate AI supply chain vulnerabilities. It will serve as both a research platform and a practical tool for security assessments.
