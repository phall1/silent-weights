# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to implement advanced statistical camouflage techniques for the Neural Steganography Toolkit to make embedded payloads statistically indistinguishable from clean model parameters. The current LSB embedding technique, while functionally successful with 3.4MB payload capacity and zero performance impact, is detectable by sophisticated statistical analysis.

The enhanced camouflage system will analyze parameter distributions, implement entropy masking, use adaptive embedding patterns, and validate evasion effectiveness against multiple detection methods. This will enable the toolkit to evade advanced detection systems while maintaining current payload capacity and model performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Statistical Distribution Analysis

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to analyze the statistical properties of neural network parameters before and after embedding, so that I can understand what makes embedded models detectable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing clean model parameters THEN the system SHALL compute distribution statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) for each layer
2. WHEN analyzing embedded model parameters THEN the system SHALL identify statistical deviations from the original distribution
3. WHEN comparing distributions THEN the system SHALL use statistical tests (KS test, Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk) to quantify differences
4. WHEN generating analysis reports THEN the system SHALL visualize parameter distributions and highlight anomalous regions

### Requirement 2: Parameter Distribution Preservation

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want embedding techniques that preserve the natural statistical properties of model parameters, so that embedded models are indistinguishable from clean models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embedding payloads THEN the system SHALL maintain the original parameter distribution shape within statistical significance thresholds
2. WHEN modifying parameters THEN the system SHALL preserve layer-specific distribution characteristics (Gaussian, uniform, etc.)
3. WHEN calculating embedding positions THEN the system SHALL avoid parameters that would create statistical outliers
4. WHEN validating preservation THEN the system SHALL ensure post-embedding distributions pass normality and goodness-of-fit tests

### Requirement 3: Entropy Masking Techniques

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want entropy masking capabilities that hide the information-theoretic signatures of embedded data, so that entropy-based detection methods fail to identify modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing entropy THEN the system SHALL measure local and global entropy changes caused by embedding
2. WHEN applying entropy masking THEN the system SHALL add calibrated noise to normalize entropy levels across parameters
3. WHEN distributing payload bits THEN the system SHALL ensure uniform entropy distribution that matches natural parameter entropy
4. WHEN validating masking THEN the system SHALL verify that entropy analysis shows no anomalous patterns

### Requirement 4: Adaptive Embedding Patterns

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want adaptive embedding algorithms that adjust patterns based on model characteristics, so that embedding signatures are unique and unpredictable for each model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing model structure THEN the system SHALL identify parameter regions with different statistical properties
2. WHEN selecting embedding locations THEN the system SHALL adapt bit placement based on local parameter characteristics
3. WHEN varying patterns THEN the system SHALL use model-specific seeds to generate unique embedding sequences
4. WHEN optimizing placement THEN the system SHALL balance payload capacity with statistical camouflage effectiveness

### Requirement 5: Advanced Detection Resistance

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want embedding techniques that resist multiple detection methods, so that I can demonstrate advanced evasion capabilities against sophisticated analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing against statistical detection THEN the system SHALL pass chi-square, KS test, and distribution comparison tests
2. WHEN testing against entropy analysis THEN the system SHALL show entropy levels indistinguishable from clean models
3. WHEN testing against machine learning detection THEN the system SHALL evade trained classifiers that distinguish clean from embedded models
4. WHEN testing against frequency analysis THEN the system SHALL avoid detectable patterns in parameter modification frequencies

### Requirement 6: Benchmarking and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want comprehensive benchmarking tools that validate evasion effectiveness against multiple detection methods, so that I can measure and improve camouflage performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running detection benchmarks THEN the system SHALL test against at least 5 different statistical detection methods
2. WHEN measuring evasion success THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and false positive rates for each detection method
3. WHEN comparing techniques THEN the system SHALL benchmark different camouflage approaches and recommend optimal configurations
4. WHEN validating improvements THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable reduction in detection rates compared to basic LSB embedding

### Requirement 7: Performance Impact Assessment

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to ensure that advanced camouflage techniques maintain the current zero-performance-impact standard, so that embedded models remain functionally identical to clean models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying camouflage THEN the system SHALL maintain model inference speed within 1% of original performance
2. WHEN measuring accuracy THEN the system SHALL ensure model output quality remains unchanged (perplexity, BLEU scores)
3. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL verify that all model capabilities are preserved after advanced embedding
4. WHEN monitoring resources THEN the system SHALL track memory usage and computational overhead of camouflage techniques

### Requirement 8: Configurable Camouflage Strategies

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want configurable camouflage parameters that allow fine-tuning of stealth vs capacity trade-offs, so that I can optimize for different threat models and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring camouflage THEN the system SHALL support adjustable statistical preservation thresholds
2. WHEN selecting strategies THEN the system SHALL offer multiple camouflage algorithms (distribution matching, entropy masking, adaptive patterns)
3. WHEN optimizing trade-offs THEN the system SHALL provide capacity vs stealth optimization with user-defined priorities
4. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL support camouflage profiles for different model types and threat scenarios

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Toolkit

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want seamless integration of advanced camouflage with the existing neural steganography toolkit, so that I can use enhanced techniques without changing my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support camouflage options through additional command-line flags
2. WHEN using the Python API THEN the system SHALL extend existing methods with camouflage parameters
3. WHEN processing models THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing embedding/extraction workflows
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include camouflage effectiveness metrics in standard analysis outputs

### Requirement 10: Research and Documentation

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want comprehensive documentation of camouflage techniques and their effectiveness, so that I can understand the methods and contribute to further research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting techniques THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations of each camouflage algorithm
2. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL include statistical analysis, detection test results, and performance metrics
3. WHEN sharing research THEN the system SHALL generate publication-ready figures and tables for academic papers
4. WHEN validating claims THEN the system SHALL provide reproducible benchmarks and test cases for verification
