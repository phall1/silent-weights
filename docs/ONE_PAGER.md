**Title**: _Neural Steganography Research: Demonstrated Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in AI Models_

---

### Executive Summary

This research has successfully demonstrated practical steganographic attacks against AI supply chains, transitioning from theoretical vulnerability to production-ready exploitation toolkit. We have proven that pretrained machine learning models represent a critical, underexplored attack vector for covert payload distribution. Unlike traditional software binaries, ML model artifacts cannot be cryptographically verified, making them uniquely vulnerable to steganographic embedding of arbitrary binary payloads without performance degradation or obvious detection.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully embedded 3.4MB MP3 file in LLaMA-3.2-3B model with zero performance impact and perfect data recovery.

### Demonstrated Threat Architecture

**Proven Mechanism**:
Binary payloads (demonstrated with 3.4MB MP3, applicable to malware, keys, or data) are steganographically embedded across the least significant bits of transformer model parameters. The modified model performs identically to the original, passing all functional benchmarks with zero measurable performance degradation.

**Validated Capabilities**:

- **Payload Capacity**: Multi-megabyte embedding capacity in production models
- **Stealth**: Statistical camouflage techniques evade basic detection
- **Persistence**: Embedded data survives model save/load operations
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encrypted payloads for operational security

**Activation Requirements**:
Payload extraction requires:

- Custom extraction toolkit (demonstrated and open-sourced)
- Knowledge of embedding parameters (bits per parameter, encryption key)
- No modification to model inference or deployment infrastructure

### Validated Strategic Use Cases

**Demonstrated Capabilities**:

- **Prepositioning**: Payloads reside on target systems disguised as legitimate AI models, eliminating suspicious download activity
- **Covert Distribution**: Single compromised model can distribute payloads to thousands of endpoints through normal AI deployment channels
- **Attribution Resistance**: No cryptographic verification possible for model weights, preventing forensic source attribution
- **Operational Security**: Encrypted payloads with statistical camouflage evade detection

**Proven Attack Scenarios**:

- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Malicious actors embed payloads before model distribution
- **Model Hub Poisoning**: Compromised models distributed through legitimate AI repositories
- **Long-term Persistence**: Payloads remain dormant until activated by specific conditions
- **Data Exfiltration**: Sensitive information hidden within model parameters for covert transmission
