## 2. Background & Related Work

### 2.1 Neural Network Steganography
Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of embedding data in neural network parameters. The EvilModel framework [1] showed that malware can be hidden inside neural network models by modifying least significant bits (LSB) of 32-bit floating-point parameters. General steganographic frameworks [2] have achieved embedding capacities up to 5000 bits with 4x improvement over existing methods. Recent tensor steganography techniques [3] exploit the massive parameter counts and floating-point imprecision inherent in deep learning models.

### 2.2 AI Supply Chain Security  
The AI supply chain presents unique vulnerabilities. Models distributed through platforms like HuggingFace create potential attack vectors where compromised models affect downstream applications [4]. The ShadowLogic technique [5] demonstrated "codeless backdoors" that manipulate model computational graphs. Supply chain attacks have targeted major ML frameworks, with recent incidents affecting ByteDance's training infrastructure and the Ultralytics framework [6].

### 2.3 Threat Models
Backdoor attacks on LLMs employ four main strategies: data poisoning attacks (DPA), weight poisoning attacks (WPA), hidden state attacks (HSA), and chain-of-thought attacks (CoTA) [7]. These backdoors persist through fine-tuning, making foundation models vulnerable to hijacking for attacker-defined behavior in downstream applications [8].
