## Research Objective

This project investigates critical security vulnerabilities in AI supply chains through neural steganography research. We have successfully demonstrated that large language models can be compromised to carry hidden payloads without performance degradation, representing a significant and underexplored attack vector in AI security.

**Key Research Question**: 
* How can we detect and mitigate steganographic attacks against neural network models in production AI systems?
* Under what scnarios could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities, how would you do it?
* What is the resource requirement for an effective attack?
